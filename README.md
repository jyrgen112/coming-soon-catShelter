# coming-soon-catShelter-app
This project is for Tak-23 final project comercial to make a coming soon  

**1ST DAY**  
Started with introductions and talking about the project.
We came up with the design, made accounts for Figma, and started working on the design in Figma.
Each of the students made their own design in Figma so everyone could practice using it — especially the 1st-year students, so they could learn how Figma works. 

**2ND DAY**  
Finished the Figma design and started coding.
Did the initial commit to GitHub, and two of the 1st-year students started working on coding:

One worked on HTML + CSS

The other worked on JavaScript to add animations

**3RD DAY**

Began the day by putting both of the 1st-year students to work on coding the animations:

One was focused on getting the countdown timer to work.

The other worked on the fade-in/fade-out animation.
